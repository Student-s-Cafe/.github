# 🍵 Student Cafe 🍵

## About Us
We are a group of students who originally started meeting at local cafes to study and revise together. Over time, we discovered a shared passion for technology and programming, and decided to collaborate on developing various tools and platforms to support students like ourselves.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to leverage our technical skills and creativity to build solutions that enhance the productivity, organization, and overall academic experience of students. 🚀
